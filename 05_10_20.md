### Notes:
1. Git & Markdown
    * https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
    * Repo = Repository 
    * Create repo, comes with a README.md file
    * commits, not save
    * commit hash
    * forking a repo take the code into your own repo
2. IDE = Integrated Developer Environment
    * We are using Visual Studio on a Mac. Visual Studio is one of Microsoft's IDEs
    * Visual Studio uses _intellisense_ to guess at what you are going to type and offer helpful suggestions
